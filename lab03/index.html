	<li>8.8 ounces Biscoff Cookies</li>
	<li>1/3 Cup Butter</li>
	<li>16 ounces of Cream Cheese</li>
	<li>1/2 Cup Powdered Sugar</li>
	<li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
	<li>1 cup Biscoff Cookie Butter</li>

</ul>
<header><h3>Directions</h3></header>
<ol>
	<li>Prepare your springform pan. Flip the base of your 8-inch springform pan so that there isn't any lip on the bottom. This will make it easier to get the cheesecake out later.</li>
	<li>Now spray it with non-stick spray and then line the bottom with a square sheet of parchment paper. There is no need to trim the parchment paper to fit. Just place a square sheet of parchment on the bottom and then clip in the sides.</li>
	<li>Now line the sides with strips of parchment paper â€“ this part is optional but does make it really easy to remove the cheesecake later.</li>
	<li>Add melted butter and process again until well mixed.</li>
	<li>Transfer the cookie crumbs to your prepared springform.</li>
	<li>Take a measuring cup and use the base to press down on your cookie crust from the top, packing it in tightly and making the top really smooth.</li>
	<li>Place the crust into the freezer while you work on your filling.</li>
	<li>Prepare the cheesecake filling. Add the cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla extract to your stand mixer and beat until smooth.</li>
	<li>Add in the biscoff cookie butter and beat it in until smooth.</li>
	<li>Now add the heavy cream and beat in until thickened and smooth.</li>
	<li>Spread the cheesecake filling out over the top of the cookie crust and smooth down.</li>
	<li>Place into the fridge to set for at least 6-8 hours and preferably overnight.</li>
	<li>When the cheesecake has set, use the parchment overhang to easily slide it from the springform pan onto your cake stand and then remove the parchment paper.</li>
	<li>Decorate. Add biscoff cookie butter to a microwave safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals until melted. Drizzle over the top of your cheesecake and then sprinkle crushed biscoff cookies over the top.</li>
	<li>Place back into the fridge for 10 minutes for the topping to set and then slice and serve.</li>
</ol>
